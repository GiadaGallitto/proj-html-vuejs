# Fitness Project Midterm

This template project is dedicated to the aim of autonomously developing a static page linked to a hypothetical fitness brand, which provides various services including online courses, the possibility of watching videos from its own youtube channel, registering on the site and viewing the partners related to the same website.
Once implemented, the project can be presented in a possible interview to show the potential and functionality required by the customer.
